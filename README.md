IP Camera Viewer and Scanner

This project is a Python-based tool that allows users to detect IP cameras within a local network and stream live video from them. The tool is designed for both home and small office environments where quick identification and viewing of IP camera streams are needed. The application features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that enables seamless user interaction without requiring technical expertise.


Features


Fast Device Scanning:
  The tool scans the entire local network for devices that have a specific port open. The scanning process is performed in parallel, meaning multiple IP addresses are checked simultaneously, improving speed and efficiency.



IP Camera Video Streaming:
  After discovering the IP cameras, users can select a camera from the list and stream live video from the device. This is especially useful for surveillance and monitoring purposes.



Simple and User-Friendly GUI:
  The program features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that makes the process of scanning for devices and starting video streams easy for users. No technical knowledge is required to use the application.



Automatic IP Range Detection:
  The tool automatically detects the local network’s IP range, eliminating the need for users to manually enter an IP range. The program will figure out the correct IP range to scan and begin searching for available devices.



Support for Local and Public Networks:
  The tool works effectively in both home networks and small business environments. It allows users to detect and interact with IP cameras connected to the network quickly.










How it Works

1. Network Scanning:
   The program starts by scanning all devices in the local IP range. It looks for devices with a specific port open. The scanning is done in parallel, significantly reducing the time required to discover devices.

2. Camera Selection and Video Streaming:
   Once the devices are identified, the user can choose a camera from the list. The program then starts streaming live video from the selected device.

3. Real-Time Video Viewing:
   After selecting a camera, the video stream is displayed in real-time, providing immediate access to live footage from the camera.

4. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
   The GUI is designed to be simple and user-friendly, allowing users to perform all actions—scanning, selecting a camera, and viewing video—with minimal effort. The interface provides clear buttons and displays for easy navigation.



Advantages


Speedy Device Discovery:
  The use of parallel processing ensures that devices are discovered quickly, even in large networks with many connected devices.

Quick Access to Video Streams:
  Once devices are discovered, users can quickly start video streams with just a few clicks, making the tool ideal for real-time surveillance.


User-Friendly Design:
  The intuitive design of the interface ensures that even non-technical users can easily operate the tool and get the results they need without any complicated steps.


Flexibility for Different Network Types:
  The tool works in both home networks and small business environments, making it versatile and suitable for various use cases, including security and monitoring.


Conclusion

This project provides a powerful and efficient tool for discovering IP cameras and streaming live video from them. With its simple and user-friendly interface, it enables users to quickly identify cameras on their network and view live footage without requiring technical expertise. This tool is perfect for both home and small business surveillance needs.
